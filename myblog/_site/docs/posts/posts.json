While the dataset used to construct diet composition analysis is for the year of 2018, one reasonable assumption made is that a country wouldn’t drastically change their diet composition if the country had been through some catastrophic event regarding their food source. And in this case the Netherlands haven’t so this should be fairly safe to use.\nThe data set for health and obesity prevalence in the Netherlands is collected from the Netherlands statistics agency which detail the rate of obesity in the Netherlands better than data from FAO.\nSet the table\nWhat do you think of when the phrase “Dutch cuisine” comes to your mind? Dutch cheese, Chips with mayo, Stroopwafels, someone who travelled to the Netherlands once or twice might even say liquorice or poffertjes, the mini Dutch pancake. But that’s it?\nWell pretty much, but there is more to the story than that. Dutch cuisine is not particularly known for their uniqueness or the spectacular taste. But in return, the Dutch enjoy a fairly healthy and balanced diet. Not particularly because what the Dutch consume daily are healthy, but rather because the people of the country follows what is called a Dutch diet guideline. The components of the guideline is found to be fairly similar to a Mediterranean diet. In one case, Van Diepen et al. (2011) found that the Dutch are even adhering better to the Mediterranean diet than their Greek counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"652e5e84e258\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"652e5e84e258\",\"attrs\":{\"652e5e84e258\":{\"labels\":{},\"parents\":{},\"values\":{},\"branchvalues\":\"total\",\"textinfo\":\"label+value+percent root\",\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"treemap\"}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"treemapcolorway\":[\"#FDB560\",\"#57A5B8\",\"#631104\",\"#808000\",\"#D2E0DD\",\"#92CF93\",\"#0A4C76\"],\"title\":\"Average diet composition of Dutch in 2018 (kcal/capita/day)\",\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":false},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"labels\":[\"Wine\",\"Beer\",\"Beverages, Alcoholic\",\"Milk - Excluding Butter\",\"Butter, Ghee\",\"Fats, Animals, Raw\",\"Wheat and products\",\"Rice and products\",\"Barley and products\",\"Maize and products\",\"Oats\",\"Cereals, Other\",\"Potatoes and products\",\"Nuts and products\",\"Soyabean Oil\",\"Groundnut Oil\",\"Palm Oil\",\"Olive Oil\",\"Maize Germ Oil\",\"Oilcrops Oil, Other\",\"Tomatoes and products\",\"Vegetables, Other\",\"Oranges, Mandarines\",\"Bananas\",\"Apples and products\",\"Grapes and products (excl wine)\",\"Fruits, Other\",\"Bovine Meat\",\"Pigmeat\",\"Poultry Meat\",\"Meat, Other\",\"Eggs\",\"Demersal Fish\",\"Pelagic Fish\",\"Sugar (Raw Equivalent)\",\"Sweeteners, Other\",\"animalfat\",\"cereal\",\"drink\",\"fruitveg\",\"protein\",\"sugar\",\"vegetablefat\"],\"parents\":[\"drink\",\"drink\",\"drink\",\"drink\",\"animalfat\",\"animalfat\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"cereal\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"vegetablefat\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"fruitveg\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"protein\",\"sugar\",\"sugar\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"],\"values\":[38,79,12,470,95,117,584,38,13,21,14,117,127,38,109,74,29,20,34,114,15,60,43,23,41,24,38,94,191,45,14,68,12,24,331,12,212,914,599,244,448,343,418],\"branchvalues\":\"total\",\"textinfo\":\"label+value+percent root\",\"type\":\"treemap\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\",\"line\":{\"color\":\"rgba(255,255,255,1)\"}},\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nThe treemap above divide the regular diet a Dutch consume in the year 2018, which adds up to an average of 3178 calories per day. The values are displaying the average kilocalories consumed per capita per day and percentage the portion is making up to the whole day calories intake.\nInteracting with the treemap, we can see that according to WHO healthy diet, the Dutch are somewhat adhering to the guideline quite alright. The key takeaways from WHO guide are: at least 400g fruit and vegetables per day, less than 10% total energy intake from free sugar, less than 30% fat intake. Looking at the treemap, the Dutch consume roughly 10% of total energy intake from sugar, and 20% from animal and vegetable fats combined.\nThe Dutch, along with other highly progressive countries in the European area such as Germany and French, are also pushing for a higher meat tax if these revenue are use to subsidise fruit and vegetable. A study even went on to analyse the effect of meat tax in the Netherlands on healthcare cost and find that a 15% meat tax will have a net social benefit of 3100-7400 million euro over a 30-years period (Broeks et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the interest of seeing how different a typical Dutch diet is as compared to the Australian diet, the plot above shows a lollipop plot comparing the net difference between various diet composition of 2 countries, only taking the largest net difference into account. The 0 line represent an Australian diet and any deviation from 0 is how much more (or less) the Dutch consume a certain item. It’s interesting how there are a divergence in preference, such as the Dutch prefers soyabean oil, animal fat and pork while the Australian prefers more palm oil and poultry. Other than that, another main difference is the Dutch consume much less sugar and drink more milk.\nYou are what you eat\nThe FAO defines food security as access to food and through it have access to a healthy lifestyle. This makes the Netherlands one of the country with best food security in the world. The data below illustrate food security on 5 scales that is offered by the FAO for the year 2019, all of which is strongly affected by access to food. The data dictionary below explains clearly what the 5 scales are. The data is measured across 4 areas: the Netherlands, Australia, European countries average, and the world average. On 4 out of 5 scales, the Netherlands have the lowest prevalence, except for anemia in women of reporductive age, which is lower than that of Australia. De Jonge et al. (2008) measures the consumer confidence of Dutch people in the safety of food in their country and find that the Dutch have high level of optimism in their food, which is attributed to the fact that they have higher trust in the factors that goes into food production.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Food security data dictionary\n\n\nitem\n\n\ndict\n\n\nsevere food insecurity\n\n\nPrevalence of severe food insecurity in the total population (percent) (3-year average)\n\n\nmoderate food insecurity\n\n\nPrevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the total population (percent) (3-year average)\n\n\nchildren stunted\n\n\nPercentage of children under 5 years of age who are stunted (modelled estimates) (percent)\n\n\nchildren overweight\n\n\nPercentage of children under 5 years of age who are overweight (modelled estimates) (percent)\n\n\nwomen anemia\n\n\nPrevalence of anemia among women of reproductive age (15-49 years)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you must be asking: well if they have such food security and well-balanced diet, along with well-known for being a cycling nation, it seems like the Dutch got their problems all figured out. But it is not quite so, food security in the Netherlands runs in the direction of excessive rather than shortage. A report by Wageningen university, well known for their social science research department, have shown that while robust as it is, the Netherlands food security still has it shortcomings such as obesity and over-consumption of red meat.\nThe plot below illustrate the prevalence of obesity in the Netherlands. Moderately overweight in the data is described as having BMI between 25 to 30 \\(kg/m^2\\), while Seriously overweight people have BMI higher than 30 \\(kg/m^2\\).\n\n\n\nThe trend is ever-increasing since 2001 for both groups of adults, which are in shades of blue. By 2020, the percentage of overweight people aged 20 and over in the Netherlands accounts for 48.5% of total population. While overweight in children accounts for 15%. This is surprising, as a country which consume moderate amount of sugar according to the WHO healthy diet guideline turns out to high quite high prevalence of overweight individuals. However, Van Langeveld et al. (2018) found that among the population measured in the Netherlands, obese individuals consume more % energy from ‘salt, umami and fat’ food and less from ‘sweet and fat’ food than normal-weight individuals.\nCitations\nBroeks, M.

Most variables are self-explanatory, however, some variables may need clarifications are:\nreproduction rate: The rating of coronavirus’s ability to spread, R = 2 means an infected person will spread to 2 more people\nstringency_index: This is a measure of the stringency of government’s adopted measure to combat the spread of Covid-19. The scale of value is from 0-100, the higher it is the more stringent the government’s policy is at the time of measure.\nnew_cases_smoothed: daily new cases taking into account 7-day moving average\nnew_death_smoothed: daily deaths taking into account 7-day moving average\nnew_vaccinations_smoothed: daily vaccination doses administered taking into account 7-day moving average\ntotal_vaccinations_per_hundred: total vaccination doses administered per 100 people in the population\npeople_vaccinated_per_hundred: number of people received at least a dose of vaccine per 100 people in population\npeople_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred: number of people received 2 doses of vaccine per 100 people in population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant figures\nLet’s kick the post off with an update on the Covid-19 status of Romania. The total number of cases in Romania is a little over 1mil, this is not a small number but compared to other European countries, the number of cases are not alarmingly high. However, a concerning fact is that vaccination rate in Romania is on the lower end as only 50 doses of vaccine were administered per 100 people, as compared to other European countries at around 110 doses. One strange aspect of Romania vaccination is the prioritisation of full vaccination rather than mass injection of first dose. Evidently, the table below shows number of people having at least a dose and number of people fully vaccinated are roughly equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"],[\"total_cases\",\"total_cases_per_million\",\"total_deaths\",\"total_deaths_per_million\",\"total_vaccinations_per_hundred\",\"people_vaccinated_per_hundred\",\"people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred\"],[1092971,57140.528,34453,1801.203,50.75,27.2,26.59]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>variable<\\/th>\\n      <th>value<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"targets\":2,\"render\":\"function(data, type, row, meta) {\\n    return type !== 'display' ? data : DTWidget.formatCurrency(data, \\\"\\\", 2, 3, \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", true);\\n  }\"},{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":2},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[\"options.columnDefs.0.render\"],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nSome descriptive statistics\nThe summary statistic is over the time frame from 26th February 2020 to 27th August 2021. Over this period, the mean daily case smoothed is 2,000 per day and mean number of deaths smoothed is about 63. The reproduction rate of Covid-19 in Romania is at around 1, this is on par with other European countries. According to the BBC, if no action was taken to stop the spreading of Covid-19, the reproduction rate is 3. The stringency index at about 58 out of 100 means that Romania did implement public closure measures to some degree to keep the contamination under control.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"],[\"new_cases_smoothed\",\"new_deaths_smoothed\",\"reproduction_rate\",\"new_vaccinations_smoothed\",\"stringency_index\"],[2005.7735266055,63.2238403669725,1.05787878787879,39914.0699588477,58.0877169811321],[2244.10258186148,51.0315036910072,0.299198246306417,27447.5870210882,17.7775968454228],[0.429,0,0.53,906,16.67],[8521.286,170.714,2.35,106652,87.04],[1172.857,46.143,1.03,34478,58.33],[3125.572,77.143,0.3425,43296.5,34.26]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>variable<\\/th>\\n      <th>means<\\/th>\\n      <th>sds<\\/th>\\n      <th>min<\\/th>\\n      <th>max<\\/th>\\n      <th>medians<\\/th>\\n      <th>iqr<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"targets\":2,\"render\":\"function(data, type, row, meta) {\\n    return type !== 'display' ?

The data table compiled the vaccination rate of every countries on the 22nd of each month. Ideally, for the whole population to be fully vaccinated, the rate should be 200 (2 shots for each person).\nUpon first glance at the table, it is quite surprising that, despite being one of the earliest countries in Europe to adopt vaccinations, Romania is notably lagging behind. Initially when vaccines start rolling out in January, the country is still in general doing a decent job in keeping up with the other European countries. Particularly, in January and early February, Romania is even displaying some promising traits when their vaccination rate is among the top end countries in Europe. However, starting from April, the vaccination rate of Romania starts to fall behind in comparison to other countries’ schedule. By 22nd of August, when most of European countries has had vaccination rate of more than 100, Romania is among the countries with lowest vaccination rate, at 50.55 per 100 people. A little bit of research on Romania state of affair and social survey can be eye-opening and offers some possible answers for this perculiar event.\nBad institution\nPossibly one of the main reasons that hinder Romania’s ability to effectively deliver innoculation shots to households are due to insufficient spending on healthcare. According to data from World Bank, by 2018, the average healthcare spending of the European Union is almost 10% GDP, while in Romania, the number is only 5.5%. The lack of healthcare spending coupled with the low transparency in public sector further exacerbates the problem. It probably doesn’t help that early February 2021, Matei Bals hospital in Bucharest, one of the largest hospital in the capital and also the centre for Covid-19 treatment, is set ablaze. According to Euronews, the hospital was under pressure, having to support large amount of patients with outdated infrastructure, overloaded electrical circuits. And this is the second hospital fire to have occurred in Romania within the span of only 3 months.\nGeneral mistrust\nAdditionally, rampant corruptions and inefficiencies in public sector have caused many healthcare professionals to migrate to other EU countries seeking better working conditions. The result is a lack of trust in both public policy and in healthcare campaigns. In a study investigate the perspective of parents on Covid-19 vaccination for their children, only 32.57% intended to vaccinate their children. Almost 50% stated that they do not consider vaccine as necessary, while more than 20% do not trust vaccines (Sandu et al., 2021).\nAs a result, despite Romanian government having vaccines ready to be dispatched, the low vaccination rate and the vaccine rejection sentiment of the general public has lead to Romanian government having to sold 700,000 doses to Ireland in August, following a similar case of selling a million Pfizer doses to Denmark earlier in June\nCitations\nMathieu, E., Ritchie, H., Ortiz-Ospina, E. et al. A global database of COVID-19 vaccinations.
